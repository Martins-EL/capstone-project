A simple Budget Tracker built with React that helps users manage their finances. The app includes authentication (Login/Sign Up) and a personalized Dashboard for tracking income, expenses, and balances.

The UI is built with Tailwindcss

I will be making use of the state management [React hooks (useState, useEffect)]

Future Improvements:

🔄 Connect to a real backend (Node.js / Firebase)

📱 Add persistent user sessions

📈 Add charts & graphs for spending trends

🌎 Multi-user support with authentication
